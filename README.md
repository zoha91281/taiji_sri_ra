# Integrative Multi-Omic Profiling of Fibroblast-Like Synoviocytes Reveals Disease-Specific Transcriptional Regulators in Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease marked by persistent synovial inflammation and joint destruction driven by pathological fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative joint disease lacking systemic immune involvement, serves as an appropriate control due to its largely homeostatic FLS phenotype. We employed an integrative multi-omic approach combining RNA sequencing, ATAC-seq chromatin accessibility, 3D chromatin interaction prediction (EpiTensor), and transcription factor (TF) network modeling via the Taiji platform to delineate disease-specific regulatory circuits in RA versus OA FLS. We identified 78 TFs with differential activity, highlighting hyperactivation of inflammatory regulators STAT1, STAT3, RELA, and AP-1 family members in RA FLS. These TFs form densely connected hubs within Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling subnetworks that drive pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL6, TNF) and matrix remodeling genes (MMP2, TGFB1). Concurrently, TFs linked to differentiation and homeostasis, such as POU3F3 and NR0B1, were selectively repressed in RA. OA FLS, as the control, exhibited enrichment of antioxidant and extracellular matrix maintenance pathways, reflecting an adaptive, stress-responsive state. Our findings define a disease-specific transcriptional and epigenetic landscape in RA FLS, nominating central TF hubs as promising therapeutic targets and demonstrating the value of multi-omic integration for understanding fibroblast plasticity in inflammatory arthritis.
