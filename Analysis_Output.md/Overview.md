## Analysis Outputs

- **PCA Plots**: Clustering of RA vs OA samples based on RNA-seq and TF PageRank activity.
- **TF Heatmaps**: Top 100 transcription factors ranked by variance across samples.
- **Pathway Enrichment**: GSEA results for differentially active TFs and genes, highlighting TLR, TGF-β, and NF-κB pathways.
- **iGraph Networks**: Visualized TF–target regulatory subnetworks with annotated hubs.
- **Boxplots**: TF activity comparisons (e.g., STAT3, RELA, IRF1) between conditions.
